# SGL-IQA: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment Using the Statistics of Global and Local Image Features
**Paper title**: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment Using the Statistics of Global and Local Image Features<br/><br/>
**Abstract**: Methods of image quality assessment are widely used for ranking computer vision algorithms or controlling the perceptual quality of video and streaming applications. The ever-increasing number of digital images has encouraged the research in this field at an accelerated pace in recent decades. After the appearance of convolutional neural networks, many researchers have paid attention to different deep architectures to devise no-reference image quality assessment algorithms. However, many systems still rely on handcrafted features to ensure interpretability and restrict the consumption of resources. In this study, our efforts are focused on creating a quality-aware feature vector containing information about both global and local image features. Specifically, the research results of visual physiology indicate that the human visual system first quickly and automatically creates a global perception before gradually focusing on certain local areas to judge the quality of an image. Specifically, a broad spectrum of statistics extracted from global and local image features is utilized to represent the quality-aware aspects of a digital image from various points of view. The experimental results demonstrate that our methodâ€™s predicted quality ratings relate strongly with the subjective quality ratings. In particular, the introduced algorithm was compared with 16 other well-known advanced methods and outperformed them by a large margin on 9 accepted benchmark datasets in the literature: CLIVE, KonIQ-10k, SPAQ, BIQ2021, TID2008, TID2013, MDID, KADID-10k, and GFIQA-20k, which are considered de facto standards and generally accepted in image quality assessment.<br/><br/>
